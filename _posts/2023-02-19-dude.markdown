<h2>Understanding CISA&#8217;s Approach to Implementing Zero Trust</h2>
<p>CISA’s ZTMM provides guidance in the development of effective and actionable zero trust strategies and solutions. Their approach to zero trust revolves around the reduction of cyber risk, increasing speed and agility to stay paces ahead of adversaries, and improving enterprises’ overall security defenses and resilience.</p>
<p><span class="marker-animation">The premise of zero trust adheres to a strategy where no user or asset is to be implicitly trusted in an environment</span>. This involves adopting an ‘assume breach’ mentality and works by making continuous verification of each user, device, and application mandatory. Zero trust as a whole requires enterprises to evolve their greater security philosophy, culture, and policies.</p>
<p>While the ZTMM is specifically tailored for federal agencies, businesses in all verticals can benefit from these recommendations and use them to safeguard against industry-specific risks. </p>
<h2>What Are the Five Pillars of ZTMM?</h2>
<p>CISA’s ZTMM is comprised of five main pillars: Identity, Devices, Networks, Applications and Workloads, and Data.</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span class="marker-animation">Identity</span> &#8211; This pillar focuses on authenticating and authorizing users and devices before granting access to resources. It involves creating a unified <a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/cisa-zero-trust-identity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">identity</a> and access management (IAM) system and implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><span class="marker-animation">Devices</span> &#8211; This pillar focuses on securing all IoT devices that connect to an organization&#8217;s network. It involves creating a comprehensive inventory of all devices and implementing endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><span class="marker-animation">Networks</span> &#8211; This pillar focuses on securing all network traffic, regardless of the user&#8217;s location or resource. It involves implementing network segmentation and <a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/zero-trust-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">micro-segmentation</a> to limit resource access and use secure communication protocols such as Transport Layer Security (TLS).</li>
<li aria-level="1"><span class="marker-animation">Applications and Workloads</span> &#8211; This pillar focuses on securing all applications and workloads, whether they&#8217;re hosted on-premises or in the cloud. It involves implementing application-level access controls and using secure coding practices to prevent vulnerabilities.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><span class="marker-animation">Data</span> &#8211; This pillar focuses on securing all data, whether it is at rest or in transit. It involves implementing encryption and access controls to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Essential Capabilities for Effective Zero Trust</h2>
<p>In CISA’s zero trust framework, three cross-cutting capabilities can be used by enterprises on their journey to adopting zero trust: Visibility and Analytics, Automation and Orchestration, and Governance. These capabilities support the interoperability of functions across the pillars.</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span class="marker-animation">Visibility and Analytics</span> &#8211; Focusing on data analysis allows enterprises to better inform policy decisions, action response activities, and build out risk profiles so security teams can proactively take measures before incidents occur.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><span class="marker-animation">Automation and Orchestration</span> &#8211; In a zero trust model, automated tools and workflows support security response functions while maintaining oversight, security, and interaction of the development process for such functions, products, and services.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><span class="marker-animation">Governance</span> &#8211; This refers to the definition and enforcement of cybersecurity policies, procedures, and processes. Senior leadership in an enterprise holds accountability in managing and mitigating security risks in support of zero trust principles from the top down.</li>
</ul>
