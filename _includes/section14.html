        The Akasha City Genesis NFT Collection is an exciting new initiative that will enable users to own land in the virtual world of Emersa Unrela Engine Space. This collection of 3334 unique non-fungible tokens (NFTs) will be built using the ERC721-f standard and will be packed with utility, including the ability to vote, discounts to future events, and access to various tools.
<br/>
        This unique collection was generated over 2022 through the use of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) tools, including text-based and musical AI. This collection of NFTs will provide users with a unique digital asset that holds a true utility and will facilitate the development of the virtual space within Emersa Unrela Engine Space.
<br/>
        We are excited to invite you to join us on this journey and explore the possibilities of the Akasha City Genesis NFT Collection. The funds generated from the sale of these NFTs will be used towards the development of the virtual space within Emersa Unrela Engine Space, ensuring that it remains a safe, secure and enjoyable environment for all users. We look forward to seeing you explore the possibilities that this collection of NFTs brings, and we are confident that it will open up new avenues of exploration and interaction within the virtual world of Emersa Unreal Engine Space. </div>
